# Technical Spec
This acts as a Rock Paper Scissors game against a computer player.  The logic behind how the computer should react to wins and losses was partially based off a numberphile video (https://youtu.be/rudzYPHuewc).  This will give the player an opponent that doesn't just throw out a random answer (unless the player sets that)

-As a user, I want to enter my name so that the program addresses me by my name
-As a user I want to throw a rock, paper or scissors, and the program will determine an opposing throw and keep a running total of the results
-As a user I want to se the randomness of the computer from anywhere between no randomness and completely random
